/**
 * Health/readiness reporting for the backend (`GET /api/health*`).
 *
 * Two distinct signals, deliberately split:
 *   - liveness  — "the process is up and serving HTTP". Touches no dependency.
 *   - readiness — "the process can actually do work". Probes Postgres + Temporal.
 *
 * Restart-on-failure should watch liveness only. Wiring a restart to readiness
 * turns a transient database blip into a crash loop.
